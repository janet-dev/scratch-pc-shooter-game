Colins Catch
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/496590825

Colin is a little NINJA crab, who doesn't like visitors in his territory. 
He shoots anyone he sees with special powered green bubble bullets. 
Help little Colin by controlling his movements, but keep in mind his orientation! 

Use the computer cursor keys: 
UP arrow to move up
DOWN arrow to move down
LEFT arrow to rotate anticlockwise
RIGHT arrow to rotate clockwise

Use the SPACE bar to shoot his bubble bullets.

Colin will change colour as the score increases, similar to a karate fighter's belt. 
Can you help Colin win his BLACK shell? ....
But beware... life is not fair and also danger is lurking, so little Colin may have to swim for his life!
